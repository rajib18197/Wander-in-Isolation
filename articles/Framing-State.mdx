**State let component remember information and we need it when a certain user action needs to change data from one value to other value.**

When Designing state in React Apps I follow a couple of guidelines that might be helpful for you:

### 1. Outline users behaviors and consequences

The first step is to write all the steps users will do and what are the results they will see by using that component. This will force us to think about deeply what our component’s purpose actually is.

So we observed what are the commands that can be given by users as they interact with that component on the screen and what are the responses they got.

### 2. Immerse yourself in only changes

We need to set a specific intention here and don’t let ourselves be distracted by what is static in that component.

Our only awareness here should be what is changing on the screen and remove static parts from our mind. This leads us to narrow down our focus to one thing only and simplify things.

Alright, that's for state design. Time for think of a few strategies of where to place a state: Ask Yourself,

⇒ which other components need that state? If the answer is 0, then place that state only in that component and we are done.

⇒ Does that state needed by many different components such as - children, sibling, parent - then it’s a global state.

Thank you for reading 📖. I hope you've got some meaningful insights about state management.
